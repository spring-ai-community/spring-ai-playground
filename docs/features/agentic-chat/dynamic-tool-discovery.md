# Self-equipping agents: dynamic tool discovery

A **self-equipping agent** doesn't ship with a fixed toolset - it discovers and equips whatever a task needs, on demand, from a library that can grow without bound. That is what turns a chat model into an open-ended agent: once it can *find* tools, the size of your toolbox stops being the limit on what it can do. In the Playground this runs on Spring AI's **dynamic tool discovery** (the [Tool Search Tool](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/guides/dynamic-tool-search.html) pattern), and - the part that matters most here - it works even on a small **local** model.

As you expose more tools - the built-in catalog, your own [Tool Studio](../tool-studio/index.md) tools, and tools re-exposed from connected [external MCP servers](../mcp-server/index.md) - the list grows fast. By default the chat sends the model the full JSON schema of *every* exposed tool on *every* turn. That is cheap for a handful, but a broad agent setup easily reaches **tens of thousands of tokens of tool definitions before the conversation even starts**, and a model's selection accuracy drops once it has to pick among dozens of similar tools.

**Dynamic tool discovery** removes that cost. Instead of listing the tools, the chat hands the model a single `toolSearchTool`. The model describes the capability it needs, gets back a short list of matching tool names, and only then calls one. Tools stay hidden until they are found, so the prompt stays small no matter how large the catalog grows.

## Why it matters for agents

An agent gets its reach from tools - the more capabilities you connect, the more it can actually do. Spring AI 2.0 leans into this, treating tool calling as a [composable, agentic building block](https://spring.io/blog/2026/06/15/spring-ai-composable-tool-calling/) rather than a single function-call step (see the Spring AI [Tool Calling](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/api/tools.html) reference and [Building Effective Agents](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/api/effective-agents.html)). But reach has a cost: every connected MCP server and every built-in tool adds its definition to the prompt.

The **Tool Search Tool** pattern is Spring AI's answer, [pioneered by Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/advanced-tool-use) and documented in the Spring AI [Dynamic Tool Discovery](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/guides/dynamic-tool-search.html) guide. The Playground builds directly on it, so the same mechanism you read about upstream is what runs here.

## How it works

```
Boot       every Local-Passed built-in tool + composed external tool
           is embedded once into a persistent tool index
              │
Each turn  the chat sends the model ONLY the toolSearchTool definition
              │
           model: "I need the current time"  ──►  searches the index
              │                                      │
           index returns matching tool names  ◄──────┘
              │
           those tool definitions are added to the next request
              │
           model calls the discovered tool, then answers
```

The index is built at startup (`ToolIndexWarmup`) and is **content-addressed and persisted** under `~/spring-ai-playground/tool-index/`, so each tool is embedded once and reused across conversations and restarts - it is only re-embedded when a tool, the embedding model, or its dimensions actually change. Two search strategies are available through `spring.ai.playground.chat.tool-search.index-type`: **`HYBRID`** (an exact tool-name match first, then semantic vector search) and **`VECTOR`** (semantic only). Because matching is embedding-based, a capable chat model paired with a strong embedding model (for example `bge-m3`) gives the most reliable results.

## How much it saves

Spring AI benchmarked the pattern across frontier models - a 28-tool setup (3 relevant, 25 unrelated) asked to plan clothing for Amsterdam - and measured a **34-64% reduction in total token consumption** while every model still completed the task correctly:

| Model | Without discovery | With discovery (semantic) | Saved |
|---|---|---|---|
| Gemini 3 Pro | 5,122 | 2,214 | **57%** |
| GPT-5-mini | 6,959 | 3,697 | **47%** |
| Claude Sonnet 4.5 | 17,291 | 6,319 | **63%** |

Most of the saving comes from prompt tokens (the definitions that are no longer inlined); the trade-off is one or two extra round-trips for the search step. Full numbers and methodology are in the Spring AI blog post [Smart Tool Selection: Achieving 34-64% Token Savings](https://spring.io/blog/2025/12/11/spring-ai-tool-search-tools-tzolov/).

## What it unlocks for local models

Those numbers are on large hosted models. The bigger story for a **local-first** playground is what dynamic discovery does for *small* models running on your own machine.

The Playground ships **107 built-in tools** (77 of them Local-Passed and callable), and you can add many more in Tool Studio or by connecting MCP servers. Inlining 70+ tool schemas every turn is exactly what a small local model handles worst: it floods a limited context window and the model loses the thread among similar tools. Dynamic discovery takes that wall away - the model searches the catalog and pulls in only what each step needs, so the size of your toolbox stops being a ceiling on what a local model can drive.

The result is a genuine local agent. Below, the default local model (`qwen3.5:4b-mlx` on Ollama) answers a three-part request - local time, live weather, and a tip calculation - by discovering and chaining the right tools out of the 72-tool catalog, using roughly **1,850 input tokens** instead of inlining every definition:

![A Self-equipping agent turn from a local Ollama model: the question about Tokyo time, weather, and a tip; a folded THINK panel; an MCP TOOLS summary reading "4 calls - toolSearchTool, getCurrentTime, getWeather..."; and the answer giving the local time, current weather, and a 1,200 yen tip](../../assets/images/chat/dynamic-tool-discovery-demo.png){ width="1084" }

The **MCP TOOLS** panel tells the whole story: the model called `toolSearchTool` to find what it needed, then `getCurrentTime` (for Tokyo), `getWeather`, and the arithmetic - three capabilities pulled in on demand. The full 72-tool catalog stayed searchable the entire time without ever inflating the prompt.

## Try it

The fastest way to see it is the [Prompt Library](prompt-presets.md):

1. Open the **Prompt Library** and apply the **Self-equipping agent** preset - it ships in dynamic mode.
2. Ask for something that spans a few capabilities (for example, *"I'm in Tokyo - what's the time, the weather, and a 15% tip on an 8000 yen dinner?"*).
3. Watch the **MCP TOOLS** panel record `toolSearchTool` followed by the tools it discovered. The exposed-tools box reads **Dynamic - searching all tools**.

To turn it on for any chat, tick **Dynamic tool discovery** at the top of the tool selector popover:

![The tool selector popover with a Dynamic tool discovery checkbox on top, above a Manual built-in tool selection toggle and multi-select boxes for Custom, Built-in, and Composed external tools](../../assets/images/chat/chat-tool-selector.png){ width="404" }

It reaches the whole searchable pool - every Local-Passed tool plus any composed external tool - with nothing to select by hand. Discovery only pays off with a real catalog to search, so the checkbox stays disabled until the pool clears the `min-tools` floor (default 10); add more tools in [Tool Studio](../tool-studio/index.md) if it is greyed out. Any preset or template you save can also opt in with a single **Use dynamic tool discovery** checkbox.

## Configuration

Dynamic discovery is configured under `spring.ai.playground.chat.tool-search.*` - the master switch (`enabled`), whether new chats start in this mode (`default-on`), the minimum catalog size (`min-tools`), how many names a search returns (`max-results`), the index strategy (`index-type`: `HYBRID` or `VECTOR`), and where the index lives (`vector-store`: a `DEDICATED` private index or the `SHARED` RAG store). See [Configuration](../../getting-started/configuration.md) for the full table and [Context Engineering → Tools](../../context-engineering-architecture.md#tools) for how the index fits the wider context-assembly picture.
