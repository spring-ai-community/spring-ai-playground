Description: Cross-platform desktop app and safe local execution layer for AI agent tools with Tool Studio, MCP, Agentic Chat, RAG, and No pass, no run validation.

# Spring AI Playground

## Safe Local Execution Layer for AI Agent Tools

Spring AI Playground is a cross-platform desktop app for building, testing, validating, and executing MCP tools in a controlled local environment.

> **No pass, no run.**

The desktop app is the recommended default experience, but Docker and local source execution are still supported when you want a server-style deployment or a development workflow.

Unlike many playgrounds that stop at prompt testing, this project connects AI conversations to real actions while making the tools it manages inside the app safer and easier to inspect before reuse:

- build JavaScript tools directly in the app
- test-run new or updated built-in tools before publishing them
- expose them immediately through MCP without restart or redeploy
- validate retrieval pipelines against your own documents
- run agentic chat that combines tool use and grounded context

## :material-rocket-launch: Quick Start

The recommended default is the desktop app distributed from GitHub Releases.

### 1. Download the Desktop App

Choose the installer for your platform from the latest release:

[![Windows](https://img.shields.io/badge/Windows-NSIS%20Installer-0078D6?logo=windows&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/spring-ai-community/spring-ai-playground/releases/latest/download/Spring.AI.Playground.exe)
[![macOS Apple Silicon](https://img.shields.io/badge/macOS-Apple%20Silicon%20arm64-000000?logo=apple&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/spring-ai-community/spring-ai-playground/releases/latest/download/Spring.AI.Playground-arm64.dmg)
[![macOS Intel](https://img.shields.io/badge/macOS-Intel%20x64-555555?logo=apple&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/spring-ai-community/spring-ai-playground/releases/latest/download/Spring.AI.Playground-x64.dmg)
[![Linux DEB](https://img.shields.io/badge/Linux-DEB-A81D33?logo=debian&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/spring-ai-community/spring-ai-playground/releases/latest/download/Spring.AI.Playground.deb)
[![Linux RPM](https://img.shields.io/badge/Linux-RPM-EE0000?logo=redhat&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/spring-ai-community/spring-ai-playground/releases/latest/download/Spring.AI.Playground.rpm)

Or browse all available assets on the [Releases page](https://github.com/spring-ai-community/spring-ai-playground/releases).

### 2. Install and Launch

Install the package the same way you would for a normal desktop application, then launch **Spring AI Playground** from your applications menu.

The desktop app bundles the backend runtime together with a launcher that provides provider starter templates, YAML override editing, environment-variable based secret handling, and one-click launch.

For macOS-specific install notes, Gatekeeper guidance, and quarantine troubleshooting, see [Getting Started](getting-started.md).

### 3. Start with the Built-in Desktop Runtime

The desktop build is intended to be the easiest way to get started without setting up Docker or running the server manually.

### 4. Optional: Use Docker Instead

If you prefer container-based startup, run:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8282:8282 --name spring-ai-playground \
  -e SPRING_AI_OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://host.docker.internal:11434 \
  -v spring-ai-playground:/home \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  ghcr.io/spring-ai-community/spring-ai-playground:latest
```

Then open `http://localhost:8282`.

## :material-view-grid-outline: What You Can Do

- [:material-robot-outline: AI Models](getting-started.md#model-configuration): switch between Ollama, OpenAI, and OpenAI-compatible runtime paths.
- [:material-tools: Tool Studio](features.md#tool-studio): build low-code tools in JavaScript and expose them instantly through MCP.
- [:material-connection: MCP Server](features.md#mcp-server): inspect external MCP servers and consume built-in MCP tools.
- [:material-database-search: RAG](features.md#vector-database): upload content, chunk it, embed it, index it, and validate retrieval quality.
- [:material-chat-processing: Agentic Chat](features.md#agentic-chat): combine grounded context, built-in tools, and explicitly trusted MCP connections in one interaction flow.

## :material-lightbulb-on-outline: Why This Project Exists

Spring AI Playground is intentionally positioned as a tool-first environment for building, testing, validating, and operationalizing MCP tools in a practical workflow.

Its current focus is:

- providing a UI-driven environment for building, testing, and validating MCP tools in a practical workflow
- making test-before-publish the default path for built-in local tool exposure
- testing tool execution flows, environment-backed tool configuration, and RAG integration in one place
- making tools easier to inspect, easier to test, and easier to operationalize before they are reused elsewhere
- supporting practical single-agent workflows through Agentic Chat with tools and grounded context. See [Agentic Chat Architecture Overview](features.md#agentic-chat-architecture-overview).
- promoting validated built-in tools into reusable MCP-hosted runtimes that can be shared across multiple MCP-compatible hosts and clients

It is intentionally opinionated and scope-limited in its current stage. The goal is a stable, reproducible platform for practical MCP tool work rather than a feature-complete agent orchestration product.
