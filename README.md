# Spring AI Playground

**Safe Local Execution Layer for AI Agent Tools**

Spring AI Playground is a cross-platform desktop app for building, testing, validating, and executing MCP tools in a controlled local environment. It helps you create reusable MCP tools once and use them across macOS, Windows, and Linux through a self-contained runtime. Unlike platforms that focus primarily on generating agents or authoring tools, Spring AI Playground focuses on making the tools it manages inside the app safer and easier to inspect before reuse.

> **No pass, no run.**

Every tool you build earns a **Local Pass** — a local test-run with your sample arguments. Only passing tools are added live to the built-in MCP server and become callable from Agentic Chat. A tool that has not passed is never exposed to an agent.

In Tool Studio, new or updated built-in tools are test-run before they are published to the built-in MCP server. You do not need to know Java, Spring, or JVM internals to use it. If you can install a desktop app and write a small JavaScript function, you can build tools here and connect them to hosts and clients such as Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, IDEs, and other MCP-compatible environments.

## The Problem

AI agents can generate tools quickly, but generated tools are not inherently safe to execute.

- It is often unclear what actually runs at execution time
- Failures are difficult to predict before real usage
- Execution is not easily traceable or inspectable

Most platforms focus on creation.

Very few make verification part of the default workflow for built-in tool publication.

## Who is this for?

- Developers building MCP tools who want validation built into the default workflow
- Teams connecting MCP tools into Python, Node.js, or mixed-stack agent environments
- Users of Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, and other MCP-compatible environments

## Quick Start

The fastest path is the desktop app distributed through GitHub Releases.

Spring AI Playground is a standalone desktop app, so you can install it and start building MCP tools without setting up a Java project, Docker environment, or source build first.

### 1. Download the Desktop App

Choose the installer for your platform from the latest release:

[![Windows](https://img.shields.io/badge/Windows-NSIS%20Installer-0078D6?logo=windows&logoColor=white)](https://spring-ai-community.github.io/spring-ai-playground/#win-x64)
[![macOS Apple Silicon](https://img.shields.io/badge/macOS-Apple%20Silicon%20arm64-000000?logo=apple&logoColor=white)](https://spring-ai-community.github.io/spring-ai-playground/#mac-arm64)
[![macOS Intel](https://img.shields.io/badge/macOS-Intel%20x64-555555?logo=apple&logoColor=white)](https://spring-ai-community.github.io/spring-ai-playground/#mac-x64)
[![Linux DEB](https://img.shields.io/badge/Linux-DEB-A81D33?logo=debian&logoColor=white)](https://spring-ai-community.github.io/spring-ai-playground/#linux-deb)
[![Linux RPM](https://img.shields.io/badge/Linux-RPM-EE0000?logo=redhat&logoColor=white)](https://spring-ai-community.github.io/spring-ai-playground/#linux-rpm)

Each badge resolves to the latest published release automatically and opens a confirm dialog with the filename, size, and OS-specific default save path. The downloaded file keeps the version in its name (e.g. `spring-ai-playground-0.2.0-M4-mac-arm64.dmg`). Or browse all available assets on the [Releases page](https://github.com/spring-ai-community/spring-ai-playground/releases).

### 2. Install and Launch

Install the app like a normal desktop application, then launch **Spring AI Playground** from your applications menu.

The desktop app bundles the backend runtime together with a launcher that provides provider starter templates, YAML override editing, environment-variable based secret handling, and one-click launch.

If you install the app, you can run Spring AI Playground immediately without setting up Docker or running the source manually.

> **macOS**
>
> Gatekeeper may block the install flow in two places:
>
> - When you open the downloaded DMG, macOS may show a warning such as “cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified.” If you trust the release source, go to **System Settings > Privacy & Security** and click **Open Anyway**.
> - After copying the app into **Applications**, macOS may block the first app launch again. If that happens, open the app once, then return to **System Settings > Privacy & Security** and click **Open Anyway**.
>
> If the app still doesn’t open because it remains quarantined, and you trust the app, one practical workaround is:
>
> ```
> xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Spring AI Playground.app"
> ```
>
> **Windows**
>
> The most common warning appears when you run the downloaded installer (`.exe`).
>
> If Microsoft Defender SmartScreen shows a warning such as “Windows protected your PC” or says the app is unrecognized:
>
> - Click **More info**
> - Then click **Run anyway**
>
> **Linux**
>
> Separate Gatekeeper- or SmartScreen-style reputation warnings are uncommon. When installing the `.deb` or `.rpm` package, you usually only need to complete the normal package-install confirmation steps.
>
> For more detailed platform guidance, see the [Getting Started guide](https://spring-ai-community.github.io/spring-ai-playground/getting-started/).

### Verify Your Download

Each release ships with two integrity guarantees. You do not have to verify, but it is recommended for production use.

**1. SHA-256 checksum** — every installer has a matching `.sha256` file in the release assets.

```bash
# macOS / Linux
shasum -a 256 -c spring-ai-playground-0.2.0-M4-mac-arm64.dmg.sha256

# Windows (PowerShell)
Get-FileHash spring-ai-playground-0.2.0-M4-win-x64.exe -Algorithm SHA256
# compare the value with the one inside the .sha256 file
```

**2. Sigstore build provenance (SLSA)** — every installer is signed by the official GitHub Actions release workflow using a short-lived Sigstore key, and the attestation is recorded in the public transparency log.

```bash
gh attestation verify spring-ai-playground-0.2.0-M4-mac-arm64.dmg \
  --owner spring-ai-community
```

A successful verification proves the file came from this repo's release workflow and was not tampered with after build.

## Why Spring AI Playground?

- **Built-In MCP Server**: Publish tools directly from the app and expose them immediately through the built-in MCP server instead of wiring ad-hoc local scripts by hand.
- **No Pass, No Run Workflow**: In Tool Studio, built-in tools are test-run before they are published, making validation part of the default product flow instead of an optional afterthought.
- **Executable Tool Validation**: Test tools with real inputs, outputs, and runtime constraints before you reuse them from other MCP-compatible hosts and clients.
- **Secure Secret Management**: Keep API keys and sensitive configuration out of YAML and manage them through the desktop app's secret storage and launcher-backed environment settings. When OS-backed secure storage is unavailable, the app clearly warns before falling back to plain-text local storage.
- **Tool-to-Agent Workflow**: Create tools in Tool Studio, inspect them through MCP, and use them in Agentic Chat in one continuous workflow.
- **Provider Agnostic**: Switch between Ollama, OpenAI, and other OpenAI-compatible APIs without changing the overall workflow.
- **OS-Independent Tool Runtime**: Tools are authored once as JavaScript and run through the same bundled runtime, so the same tool definition works consistently across macOS, Windows, and Linux.
- **Single-Agent Execution**: Use validated built-in tools together with grounded context (RAG) in Agentic Chat to handle focused, practical workflows without needing a larger orchestration layer. Agentic Chat can also call tools exposed by MCP servers that you explicitly connect and trust.

The intended workflow is practical and composable:

- create or adapt tools in Tool Studio
- test them before publishing
- expose them through the built-in MCP server
- inspect them through MCP Inspector
- index knowledge in Vector Database
- combine tools and documents in Agentic Chat

## Why Not Just Use Agent Builders?

Agent builders focus on generating tools and composing workflows.

Spring AI Playground focuses on validating tools and controlling execution.

It complements agent builders by providing a reliable execution layer.

## Project Scope & Positioning

Spring AI Playground is a **tool-first environment** for building, testing, validating, and operationalizing MCP tools in a practical workflow.

It is best understood as a **safe local execution layer for AI agent tools**.

> **Note:** This project is intentionally focused in its current stage.  
> The goal is to make MCP tool building, validation, inspection, and runtime exposure simple and reliable, so the tools you create here can be reused from MCP-compatible hosts and clients such as Claude Code, Claude Desktop, IDEs, and other agent environments.

Current focus:

- providing a UI-driven environment for building, testing, and validating MCP tools in a practical workflow
- making test-before-publish the default path for built-in local tool exposure
- testing tool execution flows, environment-backed tool configuration, and RAG integration in one place
- making tools easier to inspect, easier to test, and easier to operationalize before they are reused elsewhere
- supporting practical single-agent workflows through Agentic Chat with tools and grounded context. See [Agentic Chat Architecture Overview](https://spring-ai-community.github.io/spring-ai-playground/features/#agentic-chat-architecture-overview).
- promoting validated built-in tools into reusable MCP-hosted runtimes that can be shared across multiple MCP-compatible hosts and clients

It is not trying to replace the tools where agents actually run. It is designed to give you a clearer path from local tool prototype to inspectable, reusable MCP server.

## Anonymous Usage Telemetry

The official build sends anonymous usage data (page views, app surface, device/browser
info) to the maintainer's Google Tag Manager / Google Analytics account so the most-used
features can be prioritized. IPs are anonymized by Google. The same opt-out switch applies
to both the web app and every desktop launcher window (splash, server-splash, config
editor, Ollama manager):

- **Server / Docker / `mvn`**: `SPRING_AI_PLAYGROUND_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false`
- **Desktop launcher**: set `SPRING_AI_PLAYGROUND_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false` before launching
  the app (the launcher forwards this env var to every window and to the bundled Spring
  process)
- **From source / IDE**: pass `-Dspring.ai.playground.telemetry.enabled=false` as a JVM arg

**How is it different from other AI agent builders?**
Unlike platforms that focus on generating agents or authoring tools, Spring AI Playground focuses on making tools safer and easier to inspect before reuse. Every tool must earn a "Local Pass" through a test-run before it becomes callable from Agentic Chat.

**Do I need to know Java or Spring to use it?**
No. Spring AI Playground is a standalone desktop app. If you can install the app and write a small JavaScript function, you can build and use MCP tools here.

### Installation & Setup

**What are the system requirements?**
- **macOS**: Apple Silicon (arm64) or Intel (x64), macOS 12+
- **Windows**: Windows 10/11, x64
- **Linux**: DEB or RPM packages, glibc 2.31+

**How do I verify my download?**
Each release includes checksum files. Compare the SHA-256 hash of your downloaded file with the published checksum to ensure integrity.

**Can I build from source?**
Yes. See the [Contributing section](#contributing--scope) for build instructions. The project uses Gradle and requires JDK 17+.

### MCP Tools

**What is MCP (Model Context Protocol)?**
MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how AI applications connect to external data sources and tools. Spring AI Playground helps you build, validate, and host MCP tools that work with any MCP-compatible client.

**How do I create an MCP tool?**
In Tool Studio, write a JavaScript function with input/output definitions. The tool must pass a local test-run (Local Pass) before it's published to the built-in MCP server.

**What tools are included by default?**
Spring AI Playground ships with built-in tools for common tasks. See the documentation for the full list and how to extend them.

### Usage

**Which MCP clients are supported?**
Any MCP-compatible client works, including:
- Claude Desktop / Claude Code
- Cursor
- IDEs with MCP extensions
- Custom MCP clients

**How do I connect to an MCP server?**
Once your tools pass validation, they're automatically available through the built-in MCP server. Configure your client to connect to the local MCP endpoint.

**Can I use my own LLM provider?**
Spring AI Playground focuses on tool execution. LLM configuration is handled by your MCP client (e.g., Claude Desktop settings).

### Troubleshooting

**My tool failed the Local Pass test. What should I do?**
Check the test output for error details. Common issues include:
- Invalid input/output schema definitions
- Runtime errors in the JavaScript function
- Missing dependencies or environment variables
